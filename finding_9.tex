    Risk& Low\\
    Category& Obfuscation, information disclosure\\
    Impact& An attacker can obtain the passphrase to decrypt the disk-image file 'container.img'\\\\ 
    Description& Analyzing the file system of the server named 'plunder' running on port 22, a disk-image file 'container.img' was found. After trying to mount the image the following error message appeared:

    \newline
    \newline
    Given that the filesystem is apparently from type 'crypto\_LUKS' the disk-image is most likely encrypted. Through research the following command was tried to decrypt the filesystem:

    \newline
    \newline
    The first method to access the container image was a brute force attack. Since we have credentials for the SSH we copied the image to our local kali linux machine with the following command: ''scp root@172.16.0.29:/srv/container.img output.img''
    After copying the file a brute force attack was performed using the tool bruteforce-luks.

    However there was no matching password found with this method.
