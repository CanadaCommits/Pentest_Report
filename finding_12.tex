    \textbf{Finding} & \textbf{Weak cipher suite support}\\
    Risk& High\\
    Category& Misconfiguration, Cryptography\\
    Impact& An attacker can decrypt encrypted data traffic on port 443\\\\
    Description& Running the following nmap script: \newline
    ''nmap 10.0.0.39 -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443''
    \newline
    pointed out that the TLS configuration supports broken ciphers as listed below.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 64-bit block cipher 3DES vulnerable to SWEET32 attack
        \item 64-bit block cipher DES vulnerable to SWEET32 attack
        \item 64-bit block cipher DES40 vulnerable to SWEET32 attack
        \item 64-bit block cipher IDEA vulnerable to SWEET32 attack
        \item 64-bit block cipher RC2 vulnerable to SWEET32 attack
        \item Broken cipher RC4 is deprecated by RFC 7465
        \item Ciphersuite uses MD5 for message integrity
    \end{itemize}
	\\ 
	&\\
    Recommendation& Disable support for broken ciphers\\
