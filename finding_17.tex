        Risk& Critical\\
        Category& Cryptography, Misconfiguration\\
    Impact& An attacker can read all the data on \ac{SD} card\\\\
    Description& Due to the physical access to the device it was possible to remove the SD card of the device and plug it inside a SD card reader. The SD card reader was able to read out the unencrypted data stored on the device.
