    \textbf{Finding} & \textbf{Root access via authorized keys entry of user bluey}\\
    Risk& Critical\\
    Category& Privilege Escalation, Misconfiguration\\
    Impact& An attacker with access to user bluey can gain root access\\\\
    Description& The authorized\_keys file in the root directory has an entry.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
plunder [~/.ssh]: cat authorized_keys
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMO EhQP4e3BVrq0R9nPQz folf9349W/UDXSAbQIj6RDM joe@reliant

    \end{lstlisting}
    Given this information it is feasible to obtain root access by logging into the root account via ssh without using password.

    Recommendation& To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to remove the public key of the bluey user from the authorized\_keys file of the root user. Additionally, it is generally advised not to permit user access to the Device Under Test (DUT) via SSH as the root user.\\
