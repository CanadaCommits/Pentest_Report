    Impact& An attacker could access sensitive data. This can also happen with any user by accident. \\ \\
    Description& After performing an nmap scan three open ports where found. Since there is most likely a \ac{http} service running on port 80 a http-enum script was used to try to access several potentially interesting paths.

    \newline
    The script was able to access the ''/home'' path where the apache server has its directories saved. In this case no sensitive files were found. \newline \newline

    \\Recommendation& Ensure that users can only access paths they are supposed to. This could be done by requesting a password if someone tries to access the website or implement a login system where users have to login first to access the path. \\
