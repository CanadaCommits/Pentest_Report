	Description& By analyzing the processes of the server we found that a compiled python file 'fdesetup.pyc' is executed directly after rebooting the server. Unfortunately it is not possible to read a compiled python file without decompiling it. The contents of the 'fdesetup.pyc' file appear as follows:
    \newline
    \newline
    \includegraphics[width=0.73\textwidth]{fdesetup_pyc.png}
    \newline 
    \newline
    The few readable keywords inside the file like 'passphrase' or 'cryptsetupluksOpen' indicate that it must be a configuration for the 'cryptsetup luks' libary. 
    Therefore the file was copied to the local kali machine to decompile it. Since the tool 'decompyle6' didn't work for this specific file a script was written to decompilation:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
GNU nano 6.4
import dis
def extract_code_from_pyc_file(pyc_file_path): 
    with open(pyc_file_path, 'rb') as f:
        magic = f.read(4)
        moddate = f.read(4)
        code = f.read()
    if magic b'\x03\xf3\r\n' and magic # b'\x03\xf3\r\r':
        raise ValueError("Invalid .pyc file magic: %s" % repr(magic))
    return dis.disassemble(code)
extract_code_from_pyc_file(/home/kali/Schreibtisch/todecompile.pyc)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \\
    &However this script failed to open this file as well.
