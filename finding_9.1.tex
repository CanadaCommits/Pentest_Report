	Description& By analyzing the processes of the server we found that a compiled python file 'fdesetup.pyc' is executed directly after rebooting the server. Unfortunately it is not possible to read a compiled python file without decompiling it. The contents of the 'fdesetup.pyc' file appear as follows:
    \newline

    \newline 
    \newline
    The few readable keywords inside the file like 'passphrase' or 'cryptsetupluksOpen' indicate that it must be a configuration for the 'cryptsetup luks' libary. 
    Therefore the file was copied to the local kali machine to decompile it. Since the tool 'decompyle6' didn't work for this specific file a script was written to decompilation:

    \\
    &However this script failed to open this file as well.
