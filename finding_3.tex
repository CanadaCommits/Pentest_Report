    Risk& Critical\\
    Category& Access Controls, Privilege Escalation\\
    Impact& An attacker is able to gain SSH root access.\\ 
    Description& After logging into the user account ''bluey'' the command ''sudo -l'' illustrates the users privileges.

    The command disclosed that ''bluey'' has root access for the command: ''/usr/bin/less /var/log/auth.log'' without as password. Although there was initially a misinterpretation of the output when attempting to run ''sudo less'' on a file or accessing the ''auth.log'' file, the command ultimately worked. Upon conducting research on methods for escalating privileges, it was discovered that it is possible to input ''! /bin/bash'' into the less command line, which will grant root access to the bash.

    Executing the command ''id'' will display the current user. The graphic above illustrates that the current user has a uid of zero, which corresponds to the root user.
    The root user has all privileges as shown under the headline ''privilege specification''.
